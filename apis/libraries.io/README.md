### About

Libraries.io lets you watch packages that you depend on and notifies you when there's a new release. When you follow a package, new releases will show up here in your newsfeed.

Libraries.io can automatically keep track of all of the packages that your repositories depend upon across many different package managers.

Once synced, Libraries.io will email you about new versions of your dependencies, if you add or remove a new dependency it will change the notifications settings for that package as soon as you push to your repositories.
